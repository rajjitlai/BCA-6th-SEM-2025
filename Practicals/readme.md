# This are the list of IoT Experiments done in 6th Semester, 2025

1. Interfacing Light Emitting Diode(LED)- Blinking LED
2. Interfacing Button and LED – LED blinking/glow when button is pressed
3. Interfacing Light Dependent Resistor (LDR) and LED, displaying automatic night lamp
4. Interfacing Temperature Sensor(LM35) and/or humidity sensor (e.g. DHT11)
5. Interfacing Liquid Crystal Display(LCD) – display data generated by sensor on LCD
6. Interfacing Air Quality Sensor-pollution (e.g. MQ135) - display data on LCD, switch on LED when data sensed is higher than specified value.
7. Interfacing Bluetooth module (e.g. HC05)- receiving data from mobile phone on Arduino and display on LCD .
8. Interfacing Relay module to demonstrate Bluetooth based home automation application. (Using Bluetooth and relay). -->
