# Questions and Answers

## 1. Define null production

Ans:  A null production is a production rule in a context-free grammar that doesn't produce any new output in terms of the symbols in the language being parsed. It is represented as epsilon (Îµ).

## 2. Define Recursively Enumerable Language

Ans: A recursively enumerable language (RE language) is a language where a "computable" algorithm can list all the strings in the language. Think of it like a language we can "read" through.

## 3. State Church Turing Thesis

Ans: The Church-Turing Thesis is a fundamental assertion in computer science. It states that any problem that can be solved by a Turing Machine (TM) can be solved by a program written in a Turing Machine's language. It essentially equates "computation" with any problem.

## 4. Define instantaneous description of TM. Give Example

Ans: Think of a TM as a 'black box' machine: It has a few key components. It has:

States: Each state is a different configuration of the TM.

Tape: The tape is the area the TM uses to store its information.

Head: The head is the pointer that scans the tape.
Instantaneous: It can't remember the past, and the current state of the TM determines how the TM processes a string.

Example

```readme
Imagine a TM for checking if a string is a palindrome:
Initial state: The TM starts in a specific state.
Read the string: The head moves across the tape, one character at a time.
Check for matching: The TM looks at the character it is currently reading, and compares it to the character on the other side of the tape.
Move to next state: Depending on the match, the TM will move to the next state.
Repeat steps 2-4: This process continues until the end of the string is reached.
```

## 5. Define left recursion

Ans: Left recursion is a type of grammar that's often used to define language patterns. The recursive rules can start at the beginning of the expression, and this is a common problem in compilers.

## 6. Design a CFG for the language L = {a^3 b^n c^n | n >= 0} and convert it into CNF

**1. CFG Design**

We can build this CFG in a recursive fashion:

```
S -> a^3
```

**Explanation:** 

* `S` is our start symbol for the production.
* `a^3` means we need to produce a sequence of three a's.


**2. CFG for L**

The grammar for the language L can be described as follows: 

*  **Start symbol:** S
*  **Non-terminal symbol:** a, b, c 
* **Production rules:**
    *  S -> a^3
    *  B -> b^n  where n >= 0
    *  C -> c^n where n >= 0


**3. Conversion to CNF**

* **CNF (Chomsky Normal Form)** represents grammars in a simpler and more concise form, making it easier to analyze.

**Step 1: Build a chart:**

* The chart will represent all possible non-terminals, rules, and how they relate to each other. 
 
**Step 2: Apply a CFG reduction:** 

* Reduce each non-terminal to its simpler form. 

## 7. Construct PDA for the Language L = {a^n b^3n | n>=1} acceptance by empty stack

**Understanding the Language**

The language L = {a^n b^(3n) | n >= 1} has a specific structure:

* Each string in the language consists of alternating 'a's and 'b's in the specified pattern.

**Constructing the PDA** 

The following PDA will accept the strings in L = {a^n b^(3n) | n >= 1},  where strings must be in a specific order:

**States:**

* **S:** Initial state
* **A:** State for accepting a string in the language. 
* **E:** State for the final string in the language.


**Input Symbols:**
* **a:**  The symbol used to denote an 'a' in the string.
* **b:** The symbol used to denote a 'b' in the string.

**Transitions:**
* **S -> a** : Move to the next state with a string that starts with an 'a'
* **S -> b** : Move to the next state with a string that starts with a 'b'
* **A -> S** :  Move to the state S
 

**Accept State:**
* **A** is the acceptance state. The string will be accepted if it ends in an 'A'.


 **Working of the PDA:** 

1. **Initialization:** The PDA starts in state S, looking at the first letter of the input string.
2. **Processing:** The PDA reads characters from the input string and performs actions based on the current state.
3. **Determining Acceptance:** After processing the entire input string, the PDA will be either in the accepting state or rejecting state. If it's in the accepting state, the string is accepted; otherwise, it's rejected.

## 8. Design a TM which recognize the language L = {a^r cd b^r | r > 0}

**Understanding the Language**

The language L comprises strings that consist of alternating repetitions of 'a' and 'b' based on the number 'r'.

**Building the TM**

To design a TM for L, we'll focus on:

1. **States:** We need a state to handle both 'a' and 'b' and transitions to handle their processing. 
2. **Tape:** A fixed length tape that holds the input. 
3. **Head:** A pointer that scans the tape. 
4. **Accepting:**  The TM will stop when the pattern is complete. 


**Steps**

**1. Defining States**

* **S:** The start state.
* **A:**  State representing "a"
* **B:**  State representing "b"
* **E:**  The accepting state. 


**2. Transition Table (T)**

| Input | Head | S | A | B | E |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 'a' | 'a' | S | A |  |  | 
| 'b' | 'b' | S | A | B |  |
| 'c' | 'c' |  | A | B | E |

**3. State Changes:**

*  The TM moves its head to the next symbol in the tape according to its input.
 
 **4. Acceptance:** The TM is said to accept the input if the head reaches the accepting state.


**Explanation:**


* **Initialization:**  The TM starts at the initial state 'S' and scans the first symbol of the input.
* **Processing:**  The TM processes the input symbol and transitions to a new state. 
* **Final State:** When it reaches the accepting state, the TM accepts the string.

**Key Concepts:**

* **TM:** This TM is designed to handle strings with alternating 'a', 'b', and 'c' symbols. 
* **States:** States represent different parts of the TM's internal representation.  
* **Transitions:**  Transitions represent how the TM moves from one state to another based on input and current state.

## Design a TM to compute subtraction of two numbers

**The Problem:**  We aim to design a TM that takes two numbers as input (represented by binary strings) and outputs the difference between them.  The TM should also ensure that the input is valid. 

**Challenges:**

* **Limited Memory:** TMs generally have a finite number of states.
* **Integer Representation:** How do we represent and store the numbers for subtraction?
* **Subtraction Logic:**  We need a way to implement the standard subtraction logic. 

**TM Design**


* **States:**
   *  **S0:** Initial state
   *  **S1:** State to handle the first number
   *  **S2:** State to handle the second number
   *  **S3:** State for the result. 

* **Input Symbols:**
   *  **0 and 1:** To represent digits of the numbers.

**Steps:**

1. **Initialization:** The TM begins in state S0 with the input numbers as strings. 
2. **Processing:** 
    * The TM reads the input symbols one by one from the tape.  
    * Based on the current input and the states, the TM will move to a new state. 
    * It then processes the current input symbol.  
    * The TM compares the current numbers. 
   
3. **Subtraction Logic:**  
   * The TM uses a series of steps and transitions to find the difference between the numbers,  
   * It will have rules for handling both positive and negative values.  


**Explanation of the TM**
    *  The TM will handle a binary representation of a number. 
    *  The TM will check to ensure that both inputs are valid. 
 
**Key Considerations:**  

* **Efficiency:** How to minimize the number of transitions required to compute the difference between two numbers. 

## 10. Write a short note on Chomsky Hierarchy. Differentiate between Recognizer and Decider. Discuss TM as enumerator

**The Chomsky Hierarchy**

The Chomsky Hierarchy is a classification of languages based on their computational power and how easily we can determine if a language belongs to it. 

* **The Hierarchy:** This hierarchy arranges languages according to their complexity, with the "strongest" languages at the bottom, and the weakest at the top.  
* **Key Levels:** 
    * **L(1):**  Languages that can be recognized by a Turing Machine.  
    * **L(2):** Languages that can be recognized by a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA).
    * **L(3):** Languages that can be recognized by a Context-Free Grammar (CFG)
    * **L(4):** Languages that can be recognized by a Context-Sensitive Grammar.
    * ...and so on. 

**Recognizing vs. Deciding**

* **Recognizable Language (recognizer):** A language can be recognized if we can determine, in a deterministic way, if a string belongs to that language (without any ambiguity).
* **Decidability Language (decipher):** A language is decidable if we can determine whether a string belongs to that language, but we don't need to determine if it's valid.


**Turing Machines as Enumerators**

Turing Machines (TMs) can be considered enumerators. They can enumerate the strings within a language.

* **The Concept:**  A TM, by default, accepts the string by scanning it.  Turing machines are able to do this in a very systematic way. 
* **Strengths:** They are capable of recognizing strings within a language in a systematic way, and they don't need to determine if the string is valid.

**Key Differences**
* **Recognition vs. Decipherability:** TMs can recognize (classify) languages, but not necessarily decipher them in a more strict sense. 
* **Enumerability vs. Decidability:**  TMs are enumerators by definition, but not necessarily decidable.
